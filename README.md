# Brain-Tumor-Detection
Brain tumor Detection and Classification using Magnetic Resonance Images
-> Done a analysis study on different major types of Brain Tumour also on different
types of Image classification Machine Learning Algorithms.
-> Compared the 3 different Image Classification algorithms namely VGG 16, Resnet
50, and Efficient Net B series.
-> Made a GUI (model accuracy of 99% on train dataset and 63% test dataset) on the
most efficient Image Classification algorithm where a user can upload the MRI image
and the model will predict the Result.
